.SH NAME
pictikz \- a tool for converting SVG images into tikz code.

.SH Description
.PP
Tikz is often used to draw graphs (i.e., networks) in LaTeX.
Even though the resulting image can be very clean, manually writing tikz
code can be time consuming, especially when the picture needs to be
modified afterwards.
.PP
On the other side of the spectrum, drawing with graphical tools like
inkscape is easy, but getting a clean\-looking result can be
complicated.
.PP
With pictikz you get the best of both worlds: You draw using a graphical
tool and pictikz converts the resulting SVG file to tikz code, making
some automatic style adjustments if you desire.

.SH Options
.PP
\f[B]\f[BC]\-c,\ \-\-colours\ <FILE>\f[B]\f[]
.PP
Load colour definitions from FILE.
See \f[I]Colours\f[] section below.
.PP
\f[B]\f[BC]\-f,\ \-\-fit\ WIDTH\ HEIGHT\f[B]\f[]
.PP
Fit coordinates into a box of size WIDTH x HEIGHT without changing
aspect ratio.
.PP
\f[B]\f[BC]\-g,\ \-\-grid\ [PERCENT]\f[B]\f[]
.PP
Fit coordinates into a grid (implies \[en]uniform [PERCENT]).
By default PERCENT = 20.

.PP
Output colours in LaTeX.
.PP
\f[B]\f[BC]\-\-min\-dist\ X\ Y\f[B]\f[]
.PP
Scale coordinates such that the minimum distance in the x\-axis is X and
the minimum distance in the y\-axis is Y.
.PP
\f[B]\f[BC]\-o,\ \-\-output\ FILE\f[B]\f[]
.PP
Write output into FILE instead of stdout.
.PP
\f[B]\f[BC]\-\-rename\f[B]\f[]

Rename vertices to v1, v2,\&... (default)
.PP
\f[B]\f[BC]\-\-no\-rename\f[B]\f[]

.PP
Scale coordinates into a box of size WIDTH x HEIGHT.

.PP
Treat SVG layers as frames, using overlay specifications in the output.
.PP
\f[B]\f[BC]\-\-text\-as\-nodes\f[B]\f[]
.PP
Treat text as individual nodes instead of labels.
.PP
\f[B]\f[BC]\-u,\ \-\-uniform\ [PERCENT]\f[B]\f[]

Maximum distance for grouping is PERCENT of the axis in question.
.PP

.PP
Output version and exit
.SH SVG Conversion
.PP
The SVG standard uses the concept of shapes in its definition.
That is, there are circles, rectangles, lines and so on instead of
simply pixels like bitmap formats.
This allows a program like \f[C]pictikz\f[] to infer what a user meant
and automatically produce a prettier output.
.PP
\f[C]pictikz\f[] uses its own tikz style.
So a dashed edges receives the tikz style \f[C]pictikz\-dashed\f[]
instead of the conventional \f[C]dashed\f[] for tikz.
This is done in order to allow easier customization by the user.
If you want all dashed edges to be also curved, you can do this by
providing your own definition for \f[C]pictikz\-dashed\f[].
A sample style is given at the examples folder.
.SS Nodes
.PP
Every circle and ellipse in the SVG file becomes a \\node[pictikz\-node]
in tikz.
.PP
Every rect becomes a \\node[pictikz\-rectangle].
.PP
Text objects in SVG can become labels for nodes.
For each text, the nearest node is taken.
.SS Edges
.PP
A path is converted to an edge from its initial point to its
destination.
Intermediary points of the path are irrelevant.
The nearest nodes are used as endpoints of the edge.
.PP
If the marker\-end attribute of an edge is set, it is converted to
\\draw[pictikz\-edgeto] in tikz.
The attribute marker\-start produces edgefrom instead, and both together
produce edgeboth.
.PP
The pictikz\-thick property in tikz is set if the stroke\-width
attribute of the path is at least 50% larger than the minimum
stroke\-width and larger than the average between the minimum and
maximum stroke\-width.
.PP
An object becomes pictikz\-dashed if the stroke\-dasharray property is
set and the length of the first dash is at least twice the stroke\-width
of the object.
If it is set but smaller than that, the object becomes pictikz\-dotted
instead.
.SS Frames
.PP
For temporal graphs (also known as multi\-layer graphs), SVG groups are
used.
Groups with an \f[C]id\f[] starting with \f[C]layer\f[] are treated as
frames.
The order of the frames is the same as in the file.
Vertices which are close to each other in subsequent layers and are
equal will be merged into one vertex.
The same is valid for edges.
.SH Colours
.PP
Colours can be specified in a file where each line is in one of the
following formats
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
<NAME>\ RGB\ [0\ \-\ 255]\ [0\ \-\ 255]\ [0\ \-\ 255]
<NAME>\ RGB\ #RRGGBB
<NAME>\ RGB\ #RGB
<NAME>\ HSL\ [0\ \-\ 359]\ [0\ \-\ 100]\ [0\ \-\ 100]
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Values can also be specified as floats between 0 and 1.
In this case, they are interpreted as a percentage of their range.
.SH Bugs
.PP
No known bugs.
